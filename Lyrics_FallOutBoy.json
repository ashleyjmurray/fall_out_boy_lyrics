  "plain": "Fall Out Boy is an American rock band hailing from Wilmette, Illinois. The band was formed in 2001 by Pete Wentz, who supplies bass and lyrics to the band, and guitarist Joe Trohman, who both used to be part of metalcore band Arma Angelus. Trohman later recruited vocalist Patrick Stump, who initially tried out as the band\u2019s drummer, after meeting him in a bookstore. After the release of Project Rocket/Fall Out Boy, a split EP with Project Rocket. It was recorded without current drummer Andy Hurley due to him being disinterested in the project; Hurley later joined in 2003 as a replacement touring drummer.\n\nFueled By Ramen, who were a small independent label at the time, personally called Fall Out Boy to ask them to record a full-length record after hearing one of their demos online. This album became their 2003 debut, Take This To Your Grave, and was a tipping point between the band\u2019s underground success to success in the mainstream. It was the band\u2019s last album to feature Stump as the lead lyricist.\n\nThe band\u2019s 2004 acoustic EP, My Heart Will Always Be the B-Side to My Tongue, became their first charting release and gave fans a taste of what to expect on their sophomore album From Under The Cork Tree. The album creation was set back in February 2005 after Wentz\u2019s suicide attempt, which influenced songs such as \u201c7 Minutes In Heaven (Atavan Halen).\u201d The album was released in May 2005 through Island Records, featuring guest vocals from William Beckett of The Academy Is\u2026 and Brendon Urie of Panic! At The Disco.\n\n2007\u2019s Infinity On High saw the band subtly separate themselves from the pop-punk sound they were known for, featuring unexpected guests like rapper Jay-Z. The album was a huge mainstream success, being certified platinum in six countries and cementing Fall Out Boy as one of the biggest pop-punk bands of the time.\n\nThe band continued on their experimental tangent for their 2008 LP Folie \u00e0 Deux, breaking away almost entirely from their pop-punk sound. The group had a lengthy promotion process, which included the release of mixtape CitizensFOB: Welcome To The New Administration. Lyrically focusing mainly on themes like decaying relationships and fame, the album received a mixed response from fans and critics.\n\nIn 2009, the band announced a hiatus to allow the members to focus on their own projects. Among other things, this break spawned Stump\u2019s solo album Soul Punk, Wentz\u2019s EDM project Black Cards, and Trohman and Hurley\u2019s band The Damned Things.\n\n2013\u2019s Save Rock & Roll was recorded entirely in secret, and the group\u2019s reformation only became apparent after the release of their lead single \u201cMy Song\u2019s Know What You Did In The Dark (Light Em Up).\u201d The record generally received positive reviews, and featured several all-star guests, including Elton John and Courtney Love. 2013 also saw the release of PAX AM Days, a punk-influenced EP that is described as the antithesis of Save Rock & Roll.\n\nThe 2015 release of American Beauty/American Psycho saw the band continue to push for a radio-friendly sound, while also experimenting with samples on many tracks. The single \u201cImmortals\u201d, appeared on the soundtrack of Disney\u2019s Big Hero 6. The band later released Make America Psycho Again,, a rap remix album of American Beauty/American Psycho that disappointed both fans and critics.\n\nThe band\u2019s seventh studio album, M A  N   I    A, was first teased in early 2017. It was initially slated for a September 2017 release, and early singles such as \u201cYoung and Menace\u201d demonstrated an almost complete pull-away from their previous rock-influenced music for a more EDM inspired sound. The release date was subsequently pushed back to January after almost-completely scrapping of the material for the album. The album was shortly followed up with a limited demo EP titled LLAMANIA, which has been teased in the music video for \u201cWilson (Expensive Mistakes)\u201d. The EP consisted of demo tracks that were scrapped from M A  N   I    A.\n\nBefore the band\u2019s major project, \u201cThe MANIA Experience,\u201d had taken into effect, Pete announced that a three-tracked EP would be released. This would include a studio version of the 2008 mixtape demo from \u201cWelcome to the New Administration,\u201d Lake Effect Kid, a semi-new song and a really new song. On August 22, a surprise proclamation had appeared in the band\u2019s social media, stating that the Lake Effect Kid EP was going to be released at midnight. In its release, every song was heavily influenced by Chicago, the band\u2019s hometown."

I could dissect you and\nGut you on this stage not as eloquent as I may have imagined\nBut it will get the job done, and you're\nDone...\nEvery line is plotted and designed to leave you\nStanding on your bedroom window's ledge\nAnd everyone else that it hits, that it gets to\nIs nothing more than collateral damage\n\nTake your taste back\nPeel back your skin\nAnd try to forget how it feels inside\nYou should try saying \"No\" once in a while, \"No\" once in a while\nTake your taste back\nPeel back your skin\nAnd try to forget how it feels inside\nYou should try saying \"No\" once in a while, \"No\" once in a while2Embed"

What's this?\nThere's something very wrong\nWhat's this?\nThere's people singing songs\n\nWhat's this?\nThe streets are lined with\nLittle creatures laughing\nEverybody seems so happy\nHave I possibly gone daffy\nWhat is this?\nWhat's this?\nThere's children throwing snowballs\nInstead of throwing heads\nThey're busy building toys\nAnd absolutely no one's dead\n\nThere's frost on every window\nOh, I can't believe my eyes\nAnd in my bones I feel the warmth\nThat's coming from inside\n\nOh, look\nWhat's this?\nThey're hanging mistletoe, they kiss\nWhy that looks so unique, inspired\nThey're gathering around to hear a story\nRoasting chestnuts on a fire\nWhat's this?\nWhat's this?\nIn here they've got a little tree, how queer\nAnd who would ever think\nAnd why?\nThey're covering it with tiny little things\nThey've got electric lights on strings\nAnd there's a smile on everyone\nSo, now, correct me if I'm wrong\nThis looks like fun\nThis looks like fun\nOh, could it be I got my wish\nWhat's this?\n\nOh my, what now?\nThe children are asleep\nBut look, there's nothing underneath\nNo ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them\nOr ensnare them, only little cozy things\nSecure them in their dreamland\nWhat's this?\n\nThe monsters are all missing\nAnd the nightmares can't be found\nAnd in their place there seems to be\nGood feeling all around\nInstead of screams, I swear\nI can hear music in the air\nThe smell of cakes and pies\nAre absolutely everywhere\n\nThe sights, the sounds\nThey're everywhere and all around\nI've never felt this good before\nThis empty place inside of me has been filling up\nI simply cannot get enough\n\nI want it, oh, I want it\nOh, I want it for my own\nI've got to know\nI've got to know\nWhat is this place that I have found?\nWhat is this?9Embed"
